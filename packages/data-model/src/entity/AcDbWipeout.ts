 * Entity that creates a blank area in the drawing.

 * in the drawing. It's commonly used to hide parts of the drawing or
 * create clean areas for annotations. The wipeout area is defined by
 * a boundary path and is rendered as a solid fill in the current
 * canvas / layout background colour (matching AutoCAD).
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const wipeout = new AcDbWipeout();
 * // Set up boundary path and other properties
 * wipeout.draw(renderer);
 * ```
